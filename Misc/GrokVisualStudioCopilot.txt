Unfortunately, I couldn't reproduce the deletion of the code sections this morning. Yesterday, it DEFINITELY reduced the XAML and the c# code by 50%! 
However, I should mention that I ran the conversion in the afternoon during European time, when workload is very high because the US also uses the GitHub models at the same time. Even with Claude Sonnet, you have to expect processing to be aborted due to the high number of users.
Nevertheless, Grok Fast requires a lot of runs and doesn't fix all compilation errors. Sonnet is much more thorough and doesn't require as many runs.

Here is the link to the repository:
https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlus
Clone it an open the solution file iplusAvaloniaUI.sln
The sample files shown in the video are located in the project
gip.core.layoutengine.avui.csproj

You must run Copilot in agent mode and also use the following MCP server:
https://github.com/descriptor/AvaloniaUI.MCP
In the root directory of iplusAvaloniaUI.sln (Solution Items) change the path in .mcp.json to the location where you have cloned AvaloniaUI.MCP.
Afterwards you should be able to see the Tools in Copilot. 

For comparison, here are two videos of Claude Sonnet performing the code transformation for the same files very accurately:

It also leaves the positions of the methods where they were before. Grok, on the other hand, often rebuilds the entire structure.
It requires fewer iterations and fixes all compilation issues. Despite the longer thinking phase, it ultimately finishes twice as fast as Grok.
